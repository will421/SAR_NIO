In this project, you will find a very basic GUI for a chat application.
Please feel free to improve on it, and if you do, let me know.

The chat GUI assumes the presence of a chat room, an object implementing
the IChatRoom interface. You will wrap your implementation of your chat 
room, based on your NIO implementation, with this interface.

Please, have a look at the mock of a chat room with the class ChatRoomMock,
showing a simple mock of a chat room, event-oriented style.
